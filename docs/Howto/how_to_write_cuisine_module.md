# Cuisine module

Here is an example cuisine module. Read the comments to see what is expected in the module.

```python
from JumpScale import j
from JumpScale.tools.cuisine.CuisineFactory import CuisineApp


class CuisineExample(CuisineApp):

    """
    always define the name of you module, it's used in
    the self.isInstalled method to check if your app is already present on the system

        self.CODEDIR = self.core.replace("$CODEDIR/github/example/myapp")
